PiggyOnline_Gallery - featuring works from artist https://www.danyayu.com/

Problem I’m trying to solve
<ul>
<li>Artist’s exposure to art collectors and vice versa</li>
<li>Art is a form of expression and is for everyone</li>
</ul>

Solution
<ul>
<li>The creation of Piggy Online – an art gallery for any art lovers to explore art items by artists.</li>
</ul>

Features
<ul>
<li>Sign up page for users</li>
<li>Login</li>
<li>Logout</li>
<li>A page that stores art pieces the user liked</li>
<li>A page that displays all the other art pieces (art pieces the user haven’t liked)</li>
<li>Demographics of users who liked the art piece</li>
<li>Let’s take a look at the app now!</li>
</ul>
